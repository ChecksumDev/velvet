# Velvet üç∞ 
Velvet is a mod pack for Minecraft that has everything but the kitchen sink. It aims to provide an enjoyable quality-of-life (QoL) experience for players.

While many mod packs use questing systems to guide players, Velvet believes in simplicity. Players are allowed to create their own path and use the mods however they please. While obvious exploits may be patched, players are free to become "overpowered" if they desire.

With Velvet, you can explore the depths of the ocean, or delve into the intricate circuits of Applied Energistics. You can go out and explore elaborate dungeons in the world, or you can automatically farm diamonds from the ground with Create! Fight new mobs, become stronger, and explore everything the mod pack has to offer.

The world is yours to discover!
